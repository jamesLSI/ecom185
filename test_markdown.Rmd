## Conservative treatment ####
### table of only PCCs that are Labour in 2012 ####
### this include those that are always abour and those that change.Excluding 2024 election they all happen to move to Conservative
labour_pccs <- pcc_change_table %>% 
  filter(X2012 == "Labour")

### prepare data for regression ####
crime_data_w_treatment_dummy_conservative <- crime_w_population_w_pcc_data %>% 
  ## add in change date, and change type
  left_join(x = labour_pccs %>% 
              select(PFA23NM,
                     when_change,

                         1,
                         0)) %>%

### plot it ####

  filter(!PFA23NM == "London, City of") %>% 
  distinct(FinancialYear,
           FinancialQuarter,

           .keep_all = T) %>% 
  filter(OffenceGroup == "Criminal damage and arson") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(period),y=offence_group_per_100k,colour=factor(treatd))) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.05) + 
  geom_smooth(aes(x=factor(period),y=offence_group_per_100k,group=factor(treatd)),formula = y~x, method="lm") + theme_bw()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example this one looking at Criminal damage and arson:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(cdaa)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
